Temporary Tab
=============

An extension for Chrome that automatically cleans up temporary tabs to keep your 
browser snappy.

This is super alpha and will be changing drastically quite soon.

For now, it allows you to open a new tab (Alt+Shift+Y) which will automatically 
self destruct after being idle for 60 seconds.
